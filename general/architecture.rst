Main Technologies Used
----------------------

Python
~~~~~~

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is the main programming language
used by the server side application (web admin, API, controller, workers).

In the past OpenWISP was built on  Ruby On Rails, but we later switched
to Python because it's more suited to networking and  has a wider
pool of potential contributors.

Find out more on :ref:`why OpenWISP chose Python
as its main language <why_python>`.

Django
~~~~~~

`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ is one of the most popular
web frameworks for Python language.

It is used extensively in our modules. Django allows rapid development
and has a very rich ecosystem.

It's the base framework used in most of the server side
modules of OpenWISP.

Find out more on :ref:`why OpenWISP chose Django
as its main web framework <why_django>`.

Django REST Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Django REST framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org>`_
is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs based on Django
and it's widely used in most of the Django and web based based OpenWISP
modules.

Find out more on :ref:`why OpenWISP chose Django
REST Framework to build its REST API <why_DRF>`.

Celery
~~~~~~

`Celery <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a python
implementation of a distributed task queue and it is heavily used
in OpenWISP to execute background tasks, perform network operations
like monitoring checks, configuration updates, firmware upgrades
and so on.

OpenWrt
~~~~~~~

`OpenWrt <https://openwrt.org/>`_ is an linux distribution designed for
embedded systems, routers and networking in general.

It has a very skilled community and it is used as a base by many
hardware vendors (Technicolor, Ubiquiti Networks, Linksys, Teltonika
and many others).

Lua
~~~

`Lua <https://www.lua.org/>`_ is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming
language designed primarily for embedded systems and clients.

Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter is written in ANSI C,
and has a relatively simple C API.

It is the official scripting language of OpenWRT and it's used heavily
in the OpenWrt packages of OpenWISP:
`openwisp-config <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-config>`__
and `openwisp-monitoring
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwrt-openwisp-monitoring>`_.

Node.js and React JS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ is javascript runtime to build
JS based applications.

In OpenWISP it's used as a base for frontend applications
along with `React <https://reactjs.org/>`_, like
`openwisp-wifi-login-pages
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-wifi-login-pages/>`__.

Ansible
~~~~~~~

`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ is a very popular software
automation tool written in python that is generally used for automating
software provisioning, configuration management and application
deployment.

We use `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ to provide automated
procedures to `deploy OpenWISP
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2>`__,
to `compile custom OpenWRT images for different
organizations <https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2-imagegenerator>`__,
to `deploy OpenWISP WiFi Login Pages
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-wifi-login-pages>`__
and to deploy the `Wireguard integration for OpenWISP Controller
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-wireguard-openwisp>`__.

Docker
~~~~~~

We use docker in
`docker-openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp>`_,
which aims to ease the deployment of OpenWISP in a
containerized infrastructure.

NetJSON
~~~~~~~

`NetJSON <http://netjson.org/>`_ is a data interchange format based on
`JSON <http://json.org/>`_ designed to ease the development of software
tools for computer networks.

RADIUS
~~~~~~

`RADIUS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS/>`_ (Remote Authentication
Dial-In User Service) is a networking protocol that used for centralized
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting management of
network services.

Freeradius
~~~~~~~~~~

`Freeradius <https://freeradius.org/>`_ is the most popular open source
implementation of the RADIUS protocol and is heavily relied on in
`OpenWISP RADIUS <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-radius>`_.

Mesh Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `mesh network <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking/>`_  is a
local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes connect directly,
dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible
and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients.

OpenWrt supports the standard mesh mode (802.11s) and OpenWISP supports
this mode out of the box.

It is also possible to support other popular dynamic open source
routing protocols available on OpenWrt like OLSRd2, BATMAN-advanced,
Babel, BMX, etc.

InfluxDB
~~~~~~~~

`InfluxDB <https://www.influxdata.com/>`_ is the default open source
time series DB used in OpenWISP Monitoring.

Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/>`_ is an alternative option which
can be used in OpenWISP Monitoring as time series DB,
related to storing and retrieving data in a fast and efficient way.

Networkx
~~~~~~~~

`Networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_ is a network graph analysis library
written in Python and used under the hood by `netdiff
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`_
and the `OpenWISP Network Topology module
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`__.

Relational Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Django supports several Relational Database Management Systems
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/databases/>`_.

The most notable ones are:

- `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_
- `MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_
- `SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org/>`_

**For production usage we recommend PostgreSQL.**

For development we recommend SQLite for its simplicity .

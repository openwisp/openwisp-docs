Code of Conduct
===============

1. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

OpenWISP aims to be a welcoming organization for contributors with the
most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are devoted towards
providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless
of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
and religion.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable
behavior.

We invite all those who participate in OpenWISP to help us create safe
and positive experiences for everyone.

2. Open Source Citizenship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An additional purpose of this Code of Conduct is to boost open source
citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
is essential to prevent the many forms of inequality and abuses of power
that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute
to the fullest extent, we want to know.

3. Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community
members:


- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute
  to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior
  and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in
  distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
  inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the
  public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

4. Unacceptable Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable
within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed
  against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic,
  ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
  information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual
  orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent
  before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments
  or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual
  advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and
  presentations.

5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We do not tolerate harassment of the participants in any form.
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and
those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including
a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning
(and without refund in the case of a paid event).

6. Reporting Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are being harassed, noticed that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please
`contact community organizers immediately <#contact-info>`_.

Additionally, community organizers are available to aid community
members to engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help
those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the situation
of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by
the person experiencing distress.

7. Addressing Grievances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this
Code of Conduct, you should
`get in touch with the OpenWISP community managers <#contact-info>`_
by sending a short explanation of your grievance.

Your grievance will be handled in accordance with
our existing governing policies.

8. Scope
~~~~~~~~

All community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors;
and other guests) must abide by this Code of Conduct in all forms of
communications within the community such as venues, online and in-person
as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community
business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to
unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities
when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and
well-being of community members.

Help us to grow
===============

You don't need necessarily to be a programmer in order to help out.

An apparently insignificant action can have a very positive impact on the
project and in this page we'll explain why it's in your interest to help
the project grow.

Are you using OpenWISP for your organization?
---------------------------------------------

If you are using OpenWISP for your company or no profit organization, it's
in your best interest to help the project to grow, because the more we
grow as a community, the more contributors we'll attract which in turn
will help us to improve the software, its documentation and keep alive the
`support channels <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

**Even small and apparently meaningless actions can make a big difference
if performed by a sufficient number of people.**

.. note::

    **If you need commercial support for your business**, see the
    paragraph about `Commercial support and funding development
    <commercial_support_>`_.

How to help
-----------

.. _mailing_list:

1. Open new discussion threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Github Discussions Forum and the Mailing List
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ are excellent places to ask questions
or share information regarding OpenWISP.

Every question and its replies are archived and indexed by search engines,
creating a repository of solved problems that people can find over time.

For this reason, **using these channels for support questions should be
preferred over the chats**.

.. warning::

    Please be mindful that **over 700 people read these channels** and
    **discussions are indexed forever**. For these reasons, you should:

    - Keep the focus of the discussion technical.
    - Avoid irrelevant comments.
    - Be mindful about what you write.
    - Keep the tone calm and constructive.
    - Be respectful to the volunteers who reply in their free time.
    - Avoid generating noise.

When subscribing to the mailing list, we suggest choosing one of these
options:

- Receive all emails by creating a filter in your mailbox that moves the
  messages to a dedicated folder.
- Receive a periodic summary (abridged or digest).

2. Send feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use OpenWISP, you may find ideas about improvements, new features
or you may incur in bugs.

It's very helpful to us if you send us your feedback in some way. The
preferred way to send feedback is to use the `mailing list
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, but you can send feedback in any way
you want.

If you have found a bug we will likely ask you to open a bug report in a
specific github repository, if you can follow up with this activity it
will be very helpful to us.

3. Stars on github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When evaluating open source projects, many people rely heavily on GitHub
stars as a proxy for popularity, maturity, and community adoption. In
practice, this often becomes a deciding factor in whether a project is
even considered.

OpenWISP is intentionally modular and composed of multiple repositories.
As a result, there is no single repository with an exceptionally high star
count. New users and potential contributors browsing `our GitHub
repositories
<https://github.com/orgs/openwisp/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic+fork%3Afalse+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Astars>`_
may not immediately recognize this and may judge individual modules in
isolation, based solely on their star count.

While this metric is imperfect, it does influence perception and adoption.
For this reason, and at no cost to you, we kindly ask you to `review our
projects on GitHub
<https://github.com/orgs/openwisp/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic+fork%3Afalse+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Astars>`_
and **star the repositories you actively use, contribute to or find
valuable**. This small gesture helps increase visibility, lowers the
barrier for new adopters, and supports the long term growth of the
OpenWISP ecosystem.

4. Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find anything in this documentation that you think may be improved,
please edit the document on github and send us a pull request,
alternatively you can file a bug report or write to the `support channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

5. Social media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using OpenWISP, it's very useful to let the world know about it
by sharing a public post on social media using the `#openwisp` hashtag.

We also have a `twitter account <https://twitter.com/openwisp>`_ and a
`facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/OpenWISP/>`_ you can follow to
help us share news about our community.

If more people talk about OpenWISP on social media, we increase the chance
that those who have the will and technical skills to contribute will hear
about its existence.

6. Blogging
~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a blog post about how you are using OpenWISP!

It would be great if you could explain the reasons for which you chose
OpenWISP, the traits you like about it and the traits you don't like about
it.

This is **VERY** helpful not only for the core developers but also for
potential readers that may find your blog post and read about your use
case: maybe they have the same use case and they want to know if OpenWISP
is a good fit for them.

A concise, straight to the point blog post with some images and
screenshots will go a long way in attracting new people into the
community.

7. Conferences & Meetups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you like to share your knowledge at conferences and meetups, you may
cite OpenWISP in one of your presentations or lightning talks, you may
also show some of its features, if relevant.

8. Participate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By participating actively in the `support channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ you can also help us a lot: the
welcoming level of an open source community is a key factor in attracting
a good numbers of contributors.

9. Contribute technically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you skilled in one of the following areas?

- technical writing
- python
- networking
- graphic/web design
- frontend development
- OpenWrt
- Freeradius
- linux
- devops

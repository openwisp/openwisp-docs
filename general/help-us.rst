Help us to grow
===============

You don't need necessarily to be a programmer in order to help out.

An apparently insignificant action can have a very positive impact on
the project and in this page we'll explain why it's in your interest to
help the project grow.

Are you using OpenWISP for your organization?
---------------------------------------------

If you are using OpenWISP for your company or no profit organization,
it's in your best interest to help the project to grow, because the more
we grow as a community, the more contributors we'll attract which in
turn will help us to improve the software, its documentation and keep
alive the `support channels <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

**Even small and apparently meaningless actions can make a big difference
if performed by a sufficient number of people.**

.. note::
  **If you need commercial support for your business**, see the paragraph
  about `Commercial support and funding development
  <commercial_support_>`_.

How to help
-----------

.. _mailing_list:

1. Write to the mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `mailing list <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ is a great place
to ask questions or share information regarding OpenWISP.

Every question and its replies are archived and indexed by search engines,
so over time the archive becomes a repositories of solved problems which
people can find.

For this reason, **using the mailing list for support questions should
be preferred over the main chat**.

.. warning::
  Please be mindful that **over 400 people read the mailing list** and
  **discussion are indexed forever**, for these reasons you should:

   - keep the focus of the discussion technical
   - avoid unrelevant comments
   - be mindful about what you write
   - keep the tone calm and constructive
   - be respectful to the volunteers who reply in their free time
   - avoid generating noise

When subscribing to the mailing list, we suggest to choose one of these
options:

- receive all emails by creating a filter in your mailbox which moves the
  messages to a dedicated folder
- receive a periodic summary (abridged or digest)

2. Send feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use OpenWISP, you may find ideas about improvements, new features
or you may incur in bugs.

It's very helpful to us if you send us your feedback in some way.
The preferred way to send feedback is to use the
`mailing list <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, but you can send
feedback in any way you want.

If you have found a bug we will likely ask you to open a bug report in
a specific github repository, if you can follow up with this activity
it will be very helpful to us.

3. Stars on github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, when evaluating a project, a disproportionate amount of
people look at the github stars as a method of evaluation on how popular
a project is and if they don't see many stars they discard the idea of
using it.

OpenWISP is composed of many modules and for that reason we don't have
a single super popular github repository with thousands of stars, but
when new users and developers look at
`our github organization page <https://github.com/openwisp>`_ they may
not get this at first glance and they will start looking for the numbers
of stars.

Yes, we know it sounds silly, but since it doesn't cost you anything,
it would be really useful if you could **take a look at our projects on
github** and **star the ones you find most interesting**.

4. Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find anything in this documentation that you think may be
improved, please edit the document on github and send us a pull request,
alternatively you can file a bug report or write to the
`support channels <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

5. Social media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using OpenWISP, it's very useful to let the world know about
it by sharing a public post on social media using the `#openwisp` hashtag.

We also have a `twitter account <https://twitter.com/openwisp>`_ and a
`facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/OpenWISP/>`_ you can follow to
help us share news about our community.

If more people talk about OpenWISP on social media, we increase the
chance that those who have the will and technical skills to contribute
will hear about its existence.

6. Blogging
~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a blog post about how you are using OpenWISP!

It would be great if you could explain the reasons for which you chose
OpenWISP, the traits you like about it and the traits you don't like
about it.

This is **VERY** helpful not only for the core developers but also for
potential readers that may find your blog post and read about your use
case: maybe they have the same use case and they want to know if OpenWISP
is a good fit for them.

A concise, straight to the point blog post with some images and
screenshots will go a long way in attracting new people into the
community.

7. Conferences & Meetups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you like to share your knowledge at conferences and meetups, you
may cite OpenWISP in one of your presentations or lightining talks,
you may also show some of its featues, if relevant.

8. Participate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By participating actively in the `support channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ you can also help us a lot: the
welcoming level of an open source community is a key factor in attracting
a good numbers of contributors.

9. Contribute technically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you skilled in one of the following areas?

- technical writing
- python
- networking
- graphic/web design
- frontend development
- OpenWRT
- Freeradius
- linux

.. _commercial_support:

10. Commercial support and funding development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**If your company uses OpenWISP for its business** and needs professional
support on custom setups, development of new features or commercial
support, **you can hire a specialist which very active in the community**
so they can help you achieve what you need.

**Hiring a specialist is usually more effective than trying to figure it
out alone**: specialists know OpenWISP very well, they can suggest what
are the best ways to accomplish something with the least effort, with the
highest quality and in the least time at the least cost. Moreover, they
will produce solutions that can also be shared with the rest of the
community and become part of the OpenWISP ecosystem.

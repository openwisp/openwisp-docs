Help us to grow
===============

You don't need necessarily to be a programmer in order to help out.

An apparently insignificant action can have a very positive impact on the project
and in this page we'll explain why it's in your interest to help the project grow.

We are volunteers
-----------------

As you may have noticed, the community is growing a lot in terms of users, although
the number of volunteers that are actively helping out the project is not growing.

Our resources are very limited beacuse OpenWISP has been living solely on volunteer
contributions since the beginning of 2018.

This means that:

- we won't be able to fix bugs quickly
- we won't be able to implement the amazing feature you need or are thinking about
- we won't able to reply very fast to all the support questions
- we won't be able to write very detailed user documentation and tutorials

Are you using OpenWISP for your organization?
---------------------------------------------

If you are using OpenWISP for your company or no profit organization, it's in your
best interest to help the project to grow, because the more we grow as a community,
the more contributors we'll attract which in turn will help us to improve the
software, its documentation and keep alive the `support channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

**Even small and apparently meaningless actions can make a big difference if
performed by a sufficient number of people.**

How to help
-----------

1. Social media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using OpenWISP, it's very useful to let the world know about it by
sharing a public post on social media using the `#openwisp` hashtag.

We also have a `twitter account <https://twitter.com/openwisp>`_ and a
`facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/OpenWISP/>`_ you can follow to help us
share news about our community.

If more people talk about OpenWISP on social media, we increase the chance
that those who have the will and technical skills to contribute will hear
about its existence.

2. Blogging
~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a blog post about how you are using OpenWISP!

It would be great if you could explain the reasons for which you chose OpenWISP,
the traits you like about it and the traits you don't like about it.

This is **VERY** helpful not only for the core developers but also for potential
readers that may find your blog post and read about your use case: maybe they
have the same use case and they want to know if OpenWISP is a good fit for them.

A concise, straight to the point blog post with some images and screenshots will
go a long way in attracting new people into the community.

3. Stars on github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, when evaluating a project, a disproportionate amount of people
look at the github stars as a method of evaluation on how popular a project is
and if they don't see many stars they discard the idea of using it.

OpenWISP is composed of many modules and for that reason we don't have a single super
popular github repository with thousands of stars, but when new users and developers
look at `our github organization page <https://github.com/openwisp>`_ they may
not get this at first glance and they will start looking for the numbers of stars.

Yes, we know it sounds silly, but since it doesn't cost you anything, it would be
really useful if you could **take a look at our projects on github** and **star
the ones you find most interesting**.

4. Write to the mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `mailing list <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ is a great place to ask
questions or share information regarding OpenWISP.

Every question and its replies are archived and indexed by search engines, so
over time the archive becomes a repositories of solved problems which people
can find.

For this reason, **using the mailing list for support questions should be
preferred over the main chat**.

When subscribing to the mailing list, we suggest to choose one of these options:

- receive all emails by creating a filter in your mailbox which moves the
  messages to a dedicated folder
- receive a periodic summary (abridged or digest)

5. Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find anything in this documentation that you think may be improved,
please edit the document on github and send us a pull request, alternatively
you can file a bug report or write to the `support channels <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_.

6. Conferences & Meetups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you like to share your knowledge at conferences and meetups, you may cite
OpenWISP in one of your presentations or lightining talks, you may also show
some of its featues, if relevant.

7. Participate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By participating actively in the `support channels <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_
you can also help us a lot: the welcoming level of an open source community
is a key factor in attracting a good numbers of contributors.

8. Fund development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**If your company uses OpenWISP for its business** and needs professional support
on custom setups or development of new features, **you may hire somebody which
very active in the community** so they can help you achieve what you need.

**Hiring a specialist is usually more effective than trying to figure it out alone**:
specialists know OpenWISP very well, they can suggest what are the best ways to
accomplish something with the least effort, with the highest quality and in the
least time at the least cost. Moreover, they will produce solutions that can
also be shared with the rest of the community and become part of the OpenWISP ecosystem.

To find an OpenWISP expert, look in our `communication channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, especially the mailing list.

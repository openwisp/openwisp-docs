Quickstart

**Warning**: this document is still a work in progress.

1. Install the OpenWISP 2 server
--------------------------------

If you want to install for testing purposes we suggest to use
`vagrant-openwisp2 <https://github.com/openwisp/vagrant-openwisp2>`_.

If you want to find out how to deploy OpenWISP for production usage,
follow the step by step `ansible-openwisp2 tutorial
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2#usage-tutorial>`_.

2. Install openwisp-config on your devices
------------------------------------------

Here's a guide on :doc:`how to install openwisp-config on OpenWRT
and connect it to OpenWISP <./configure-device>`.

If you don't have a physical OpenWRT-compatible device at hand, you can
install OpenWRT in a VirtualBox VM, that's also covered by the guide.

3. Watch video demonstrations

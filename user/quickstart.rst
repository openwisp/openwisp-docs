Try the Demo

Before installing OpenWISP, we recommend trying out the :doc:`OpenWISP

the system works.

Once you have explored the demo, you can install your own instance by
following the instructions below.

Install OpenWISP
----------------

For production usage, we recommend :doc:`Deploying OpenWISP with the
Ansible OpenWISP role </ansible/user/quickstart>`.

Alternatively, you can use :doc:`Docker OpenWISP
</docker/user/quickstart>`.

Make Sure OpenWISP Can Reach Your Devices
-----------------------------------------

For smooth operations, please :doc:`Setup a Management Network
</user/vpn>`.

Configure Your OpenWrt Devices
------------------------------

Follow the guide to :doc:`Configure Your OpenWrt Devices
<./configure-device>`.

If you don't have a physical OpenWrt-compatible device, you can install
OpenWrt in a VirtualBox VM. The guide above covers how to do this.

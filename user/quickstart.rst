1. Install the OpenWISP server application
------------------------------------------

If you want to find out how to deploy OpenWISP for production usage,
follow the step by step `ansible-openwisp2 tutorial
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2#usage-tutorial>`_.

Alternatively, there's also `docker-openwisp
<https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp>`_ (in alpha stage) which can
be especially useful for testing purposes.

For testing purposes `vagrant-openwisp2
<https://github.com/openwisp/vagrant-openwisp2>`_ can be used as well.

2. Install openwisp-config on your devices
------------------------------------------

Here's a guide on :doc:`how to install openwisp-config on OpenWRT and
connect it to OpenWISP <./configure-device>`.

If you don't have a physical OpenWRT-compatible device at hand, you can
install OpenWRT in a VirtualBox VM, that's also covered by the guide.

3. Install openwisp-monitoring on your devices
----------------------------------------------

If you want to take advantage of the features offered by the monitoring
module of OpenWISP, read the :doc:`Monitoring Quickstart Guide
<./monitoring>`.

4. Watch video demonstrations
-----------------------------

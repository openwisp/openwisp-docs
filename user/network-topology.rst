`OpenWISP Network Topology
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/tree/1.0>`_
is a network topology collector and visualizer
web application and API, it allows to collect network topology data from different
networking software (dynamic mesh routing protocols, OpenVPN), store it,
visualize it, edit its details, it also provides hooks (a.k.a
`Django signals <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/signals/>`_)
to execute code when the status of a link changes.

When used in conjunction with
`OpenWISP Controller <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller>`_
and
`OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring>`_,
it
`makes the monitoring system faster in detecting change to the network
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/tree/1.0#integration-with-openwisp-controller-and-openwisp-monitoring>`_.

Deploy instructions
-------------------

See `Enabling the network topology module
on the OpenWISP 22.05 ansible role documentation
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/tree/22.05#enabling-the-network-topology-module>`_.

This module is also available in
`docker-openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp>`_
although its usage is not recommended for production usage yet, unless
the reader is willing to invest effort in adapting the docker images
and configurations to overcome any roadblocks encountered.

Quickstart Guide
----------------

This module works by periodically collecting the network topology
graph data of the `supported networking software or formats
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/tree/1.0#available-features>`_.
The data has to be either fetched by the application or received in POST API
requests, therefore after deploying the application, additional steps are required
to make the data collection and visualization work, read on to find out how.

Creating a topology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/raw/docs/docs/quickstart-topology.gif

1. Create a topology object by going to *Network Topology* > *Topologies*
   > *Add topology*.
2. Give an appropriate label to the topology.
3. Select the *topology format* from the dropdown menu. The *topology format*
   determines which parser should be used to process topology data.
4. Select the *Strategy* for updating this topology.

   - If you are using `FETCH strategy <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/tree/1.0#fetch-strategy>`_, then enter the
     URL for fetching topology data in the *Url* field.
   - If you are using `RECEIVE strategy <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/tree/1.0#receive-strategy>`_, you will get the
     *URL* for sending topology data. The *RECEIVE* strategy provides an
     additional field *expiration time*. This can be used to add delay in
     marking missing links as down.

Sending data for topology with RECEIVE strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/raw/docs/docs/quickstart-receive.gif

1. Copy the *URL* generated by OpenWISP for sending the topology data.

   E.g., in our case the URL is ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/network-topology/topology/d17e539a-1793-4be2-80a4-c305eca64fd8/receive/?key=cMGsvio8q0L0BGLd5twiFHQOqIEKI423``.

2. Create a script (eg: ``/opt/send-topology.sh``) which sends the topology
   data using ``POST``, in the example script below we are sending the
   status log data of OpenVPN but the same code can be applied to other
   formats by replacing ``cat /var/log/openvpn/tun0.stats`` with the
   actual command which returns the network topology output:

.. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash

    # Get OpenVPN topology data from OpenVPN management interface
    cat /var/log/openvpn/tun0.stats |
        # Upload the topology data to OpenWISP
        curl -s -X POST \
            --data-binary @- \
            --header "Content-Type: text/plain" \
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/network-topology/topology/d17e539a-1793-4be2-80a4-c305eca64fd8/receive/?key=cMGsvio8q0L0BGLd5twiFHQOqIEKI423

3. Add the ``/opt/send-topology.sh`` script created in the previous step
   to the crontab, here's an example which sends the topology data every 5 minutes:

.. code-block:: shell

    # flag script as executable
    chmod +x /opt/send-topology.sh
    # open crontab
    crontab -e

    ## Add the following line and save

    echo */5 * * * * /opt/send-topology.sh

4. Once the steps above are completed, you should see nodes and links
   being created automatically, you can see the network topology graph
   from the admin page of the topology change page
   (you have to click on the *View topology graph* button in the upper
   right part of the page)
   or, alternatively, a non-admin visualizer page is also available at
   the URL ``/topology/topology/<TOPOLOGY-UUID>/``.

Connect OpenWRT to OpenWISP2
============================

This page will guide you through the installation of
`openwisp-config <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-config>`_ on a
device which supports `OpenWRT <https://openwrt.org/>`_.

If you don't have a physical device available but you still want to try
out OpenWISP, you can use a Virtual Machine.

1. Install OpenWISP2
--------------------

Refer to the  `OpenWISP 2 installation tutorial
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2#usage-tutorial>`_

2. Install OpenWRT on VirtualBox
--------------------------------

Follow the `OpenWrt on VirtualBox Howto
<https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/virtualization/virtualbox-vm>`_.

.. note::

    It's required to enable SSH access and connect the VM to the internet.

    Note that both Adapter1 and Adapter2 use
    "Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop". Also, please do
    not use the same IP Address that you used for the local OpenWISP
    website you hosted before. That suggested change applies only when
    you boot into the OpenWRT device as per the description of the
    above link (for example, if you set 192.168.56.2 as the IP Address
    of your local OpenWISP website, please use another IP such as
    192.168.56.3 for the IP Address of the OpenWRT device).


3. Install openwisp-config on your OpenWRT instance
---------------------------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install openwisp-config in your device. For this guide, we will choose the
``openssl`` variant but you have other variants available on
`downloads.openwisp.io <http://downloads.openwisp.io/openwisp-config/latest/>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

    opkg update
    opkg install http://downloads.openwisp.io/openwisp-config/latest/openwisp-config-openssl_0.4.6a-1_all.ipk

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once it's installed, we need to configure it to connect to our OpenWISP2
controller. To do that, edit the config file located at
``/etc/config/openwisp``.

You will see the default config file, something like the following
(if your instance lacks some of the lines in the following,
please add them):

::

    # For more information about the config options please see the README
    # or https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-config#configuration-options

    config controller 'http'
        #option url 'https://openwisp2.mynetwork.com'
        #option interval '120'
        #option verify_ssl '1'
        #option shared_secret ''
        #option consistent_key '1'
        #option mac_interface 'eth0'
        #option management_interface 'tun0'
        #option merge_config '1'
        #option test_config '1'
        #option test_script '/usr/sbin/mytest'
        #option hardware_id_script '/usr/sbin/read_hw_id'
        #option hardware_id_key '1'
        option uuid ''
        option key ''
        # curl options
        #option connect_timeout '15'
        #option max_time '30'
        #option capath '/etc/ssl/certs'
        #option cacert '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
        # hooks
        #option pre_reload_hook '/usr/sbin/my_pre_reload_hook'
        #option post_reload_hook '/usr/sbin/my_post_reload_hook'

Uncomment and change the following fields:

- ``url``: the hostname of your OpenWISP2 controller (for example, if
  you are hosting your OpenWISP server locally and you set the IP Address
  to "192.168.56.2", the url would be ``https://192.168.56.2``).
- ``verify_ssl``: set to ``'0'`` if your controller's SSL certificate is
  self-signed; in production you will need a valid SSL certificate to
  keep your instance secure
- ``shared_secret``: you can retrieve this from OpenWISP2 admin panel, in
  the Organization settings. The list of organizations is available at
  ``/admin/openwisp_users/organization/``.

.. note::

    When testing or developing using the Django development server
    directly from your computer, make sure the server listens on all
    interfaces (``./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000``) and then just
    point openwisp to use your local IP address
    (e.g. ``http://192.168.1.34:8000``)

Save the file and start openwisp-config:

.. code-block:: bash

    /etc/init.d/openwisp_config restart

Your OpenWRT instance should register itself to your openwisp2 controller.
Check the devices menu on the admin panel to make sure your OpenWRT
instance is registered.

Compile your own OpenWRT image
------------------------------

You may want to compile a custom OpenWRT image to save time on configuring
new devices. By compiling a custom image, you can pre-install
openwisp-config, including your configurations (e.g. ``url`` and
``shared_secret``), so that you won't have to go through the configuration
process again.

This will make you save a lot of time if you need to manage many devices!

openwisp-config documentation

`OpenWISP Monitoring
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/tree/1.0>`_
is available since OpenWISP 22.05 and focuses
on allowing users to know the status of their devices at any given time.

Deploy instructions
-------------------

The monitoring module is enabled by default in the
`OpenWISP 22.05 ansible role
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/tree/22.05>`_.

It's also available in
`docker-openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp>`_
although its usage is not recommended for production usage yet, unless
the reader is willing to invest effort in adapting the docker images
and configurations to overcome any problems encountered.

Quickstart Guide
----------------

This guide assumes you have the
`OpenWISP Monitoring
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/tree/1.0>`_ module enabled
on your OpenWISP server application and you have already followed
the steps to :doc:`install openwisp-config on your OpenWRT
devices <./configure-device>`.

Install monitoring packages on the device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Install the openwrt-openwisp-monitoring packages
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwrt-openwisp-monitoring/tree/0.1.0#install-pre-compiled-packages>`_
on your device.

These packages collect and send the
monitoring data from the device to OpenWISP Monitoring and
are required to collect `metrics
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/tree/1.0#openwisp_monitoring_metrics>`_
like interface traffic, WiFi clients, CPU load, memory usage, etc.

.. _openwisp_reach_devices:

Make sure OpenWISP can reach your devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to perform `active checks <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/tree/1.0#available-checks>`_
and other actions like
`triggering the push of configuration changes
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/tree/1.0#how-to-configure-push-updates>`_,
`executing shell commands
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/tree/1.0#sending-commands-to-devices>`_ or
`performing firmware upgrades
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/tree/1.0#perform-a-firmware-upgrade-to-a-specific-device>`_,
**the OpenWISP server needs to be able to reach the network devices**.

There are mainly two deployment scenarios for OpenWISP:

1. the OpenWISP server is deployed on the public internet and the
   devices are geographically distributed across different locations:
   **in this case a management tunnel is needed**
2. the OpenWISP server is deployed on a computer/server which is
   located in the same Layer 2 network (that is, in the same LAN)
   where the devices are located.
   **In this case a management tunnel is NOT needed**

1. Public internet deployment
#############################

This is the most common scenario:


- the OpenWISP server is deployed to the public internet, hence the
  server has a public IPv4 (and IPv6) address and usually a valid
  SSL certificate provided by Mozilla Letsencrypt or another SSL provider
- the network devices are geographically distributed across different
  locations (different cities, different regions, different countries)

In this scenario, the OpenWISP application will not be able to reach the
devices unless a management tunnel is used, for that reason having a
management VPN like OpenVPN, Wireguard, ZeroTier or any other tunneling
solution is paramount, not only to allow OpenWISP to work properly,
but also to be able to perform debugging and troubleshooting when needed.

In this scenario, the following requirements are needed:

- a VPN server must be installed in a way that the OpenWISP
  server can reach the VPN peers. For more information on how to do this
  via OpenWISP please refer to the following sections:

  - `OpenVPN tunnel automation
    <https://openwisp.io/docs/user/vpn.html>`_
  - `Wireguard tunnel automation
    <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/tree/1.0#how-to-setup-wireguard-tunnels>`_

- If you prefer to use other tunneling solutions (L2TP, Softether, etc.)
  and know how to configure those solutions on your own,
  please do so.
  If the OpenWISP server is connected to a network infrastructure
  which allows it to reach the devices via pre-existing tunneling or
  Intranet solutions (eg: MPLS, SD-WAN), then setting up a VPN server
  is not needed, as long as there's a dedicated interface on OpenWrt
  which has an IP address assigned to it and which is reachable from
  the OpenWISP server.

- The devices must be configured to join the management
  tunnel automatically, either via a pre-existing configuration in
  the firmware or via an
  `OpenWISP Template <https://openwisp.io/docs/user/templates.html>`_.

- The `openwisp-config <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-config>`_
  agent on the devices must be configured to specify the
  ``management_interface`` option, the agent will communicate the
  IP of the management interface to the OpenWISP Server and OpenWISP will
  use the management IP for reaching the device.

  For example, if the *management interface* is named ``tun0``,
  the openwisp-config configuration should look like the following
  example:

.. code-block:: text

    # In /etc/config/openwisp on the device

    config controller 'http'
        # ... other configuration directives ...
        option management_interface 'tun0'

2. LAN deployment
#################

When the OpenWISP server and the network devices are deployed in the same
L2 network (eg: an office LAN) and the OpenWISP server is reachable
on the LAN address, OpenWISP can then use the **Last IP** field of the
devices to reach them.

In this scenario it's necessary to set the
`"OPENWISP_MONITORING_MANAGEMENT_IP_ONLY"
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/tree/1.0#openwisp-monitoring-management-ip-only>`_
setting to ``False``.

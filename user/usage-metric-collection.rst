Collection of Usage Metrics

We collect data on OpenWISP usage to gauge user engagement, satisfaction,
and upgrade patterns. This informs our development decisions, ensuring
continuous improvement aligned with user needs. This data includes

- Enabled OpenWISP modules: A list of the enabled OpenWISP modules
  along with their respective versions
- OS details: Information on the operating system, including its

To enhance our understanding and management of this data, we have

usage metrics without compromising user privacy. It provides us with the
means to make data-driven decisions while respecting our users' rights and

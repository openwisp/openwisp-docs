How to use configuration variables
==================================

Sometimes the configuration is not exactly equal on all the devices,
some parameters are unique to each device or need to be changed
by the user.

In these cases it is possible to use configuration variables in
conjunction with templates, this feature is also known as
*configuration context*, think of
it like a dictionary which is passed to the function which renders the
configuration, so that it can fill variables according to the passed
context.

The different ways in which variables are defined are described below.

Predefined device variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each device gets the following attributes passed as configuration
variables:

* ``id``
* ``key``
* ``name``
* ``mac_address``

User defined device variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the device configuration section you can find a section named
"Configuration variables" where it is possible to define the configuration
variables and their values, as shown in the example below:

   :alt: context

Template default values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's possible to specify the default values of variables
defined in a template.

This allows to achieve 2 goals:

1. pass schema validation without errors (otherwise it would not be
   possible to save the template in the first place)
2. provide good default values that are valid in most cases but can be
   overridden in the device if needed

These default values will be overridden by the
`User defined device variables <#user-defined-device-variables>`_.

The default values of variables can be manipulated from the section
"configuration variables" in the edit template page:

  :alt: default values

Global variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables can also be defined globally using the
`OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_CONTEXT <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#openwisp-controller-context>`_ setting.

System defined variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Predefined device variables, global variables and other variables that
are automatically managed by the system (eg: when using templates of
type VPN-client) are displayed in the admin UI as
*System Defined Variables* in read-only mode.

Example usage of variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a typical use case, the WiFi SSID and WiFi password.
You don't want to define this for every device, but you may want to
allow operators to easily change the SSID or WiFi password for a
specific device without having to re-define the whole wifi interface
to avoid duplicating information.

This would be the template:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "interfaces": [
            {
                "type": "wireless",
                "name": "wlan0",
                "wireless": {
                    "mode": "access_point",
                    "radio": "radio0",
                    "ssid": "{{wlan0_ssid}}",
                    "encryption": {
                        "protocol": "wpa2_personal",
                        "key": "{{wlan0_password}}",
                        "cipher": "auto"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }

These would be the default values in the template:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "wlan0_ssid": "SnakeOil PublicWiFi",
        "wlan0_password": "Snakeoil_pwd!321654"
    }

The default values can then be overridden at
`device level <#user-defined-device-variables>`_ if needed, eg:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "wlan0_ssid": "Room 23 ACME Hotel",
        "wlan0_password": "room_23pwd!321654"
    }

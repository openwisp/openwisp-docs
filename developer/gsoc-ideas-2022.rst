General suggestions and warnings
--------------------------------

- **Project ideas describe the goals we want to achieve
  but may miss details that have to be defined during the project**:
  we expect students to do their own research, propose solutions and be
  ready to deal with uncertainty and solve challenges that
  will come up during the project

- **Code and prototypes are preferred over detailed
  documents and unreliable estimates**:
  rather than using your time to write a very long
  application document, we suggest to invest in writing a prototype
  (which means the code may be thrown out entirely) which will help you
  understand the challenges of the project you want to work on; your
  application should refer to the prototype or other Github contributions
  you made to OpenWISP that show you have the capability to succeed in the
  project idea you are applying for.

- **Students who have either shown to have or have shown to be
  fast learners for the required hard and soft skills by
  contributing to OpenWISP have a lot more chances of being accepted**:
  in order to get started contributing refer to the
  :doc:`OpenWISP Contributing Guidelines <../developer/contributing>`

- **Get trained in the projects you want to apply for**: once
  applicants have completed some basic training by
  :doc:`contributing to OpenWISP <../developer/contributing>`
  we highly suggest to start working on
  some aspects of the project they are
  interested in applying: all projects
  listed this year are improvements
  of existing modules so these modules
  already have a list of open issues
  which can be solved as part of your advanced training.
  It will also be possible to complete some of the tasks listed in
  the project idea right now before GSoC starts.
  We will list some easy tasks in the project idea for this purpose.

Improve netjsongraph.js for its new release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/netjsongraph-default.png

.. Important::

  Languages and technologies used:
  **Javascript**, **NodeJS**, **HTML**, **CSS**

  **Mentors**: Federico Capoano (more mentors TBA).

  **Project size**: 350 hours.

  **Difficulty rate**: medium/hard.

The goal of this project is to improve the new version of the
netjsongraph.js visualization library, which is has not been released yet
and is available in the `gsoc2019 branch of netjsongraph.js on github
<https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/tree/gsoc2019>`_.

Pre-requisites to work on this project
######################################

The contributor should have a proven track record and experience with
Javascript, React JS, NodeJS, HTML and CSS.

Familiarity with
`OpenWISP Network Topology <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`__
and `OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring>`__
is a plus.

Expected outcomes
#################

- We want to make the geographic map feature
  and the logical map feature more similar to
  `MeshViewer <https://github.com/ffrgb/meshviewer>`_,
  see the screenshots below for reference, you can find
  a demo of this application in the repository just linked.

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/mesh-viewer-map-view.png

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/mesh-viewer-logic-view.png

- Fix zoom animation: when the map is zoomed, there's a delay between the
  zoom of the map and the repositioning of the elements which
  looks pretty weird
- Add a clustering feature to the geographic map: when there are
  multiple overlapping elements group them as one cluster:

   - the cluster shall expand when it's hovered with the mouse
   - the cluster shall expand when the map zoom increases
   - the cluster may behave differently if the nodes have links to other
     nodes, a solution which works well aesthetically should be found

- Test the library on narrow screens and ensure quirks are fixed
- Add support for loading map data using GeoJSON
- Allow loading more than 1000 devices by using pagination,
  load max 10K points by default (eg: ``maxPointsFetched``), make this
  max value configurable
- When more points are present than the configured ``maxPointsFetched``
  value, if the map is zoomed more than a specific level (which shall also
  be configurable and have a good default), load more data from the API
  by specifying geographic extent, implement a mocking server for this
  feature on the server side
- Update `OpenWISP Network Topology <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`__
  to use the new version of this library
- Modify `OpenWISP Network Topology <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`__
  to provide `real time updates <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/tree/gsoc2019#realtime-update>`_
- Change the code of `OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring>`__
  so that the map dashboard is implemented
  using this library instead of using its own custom implementation

Keep in mind the underlying visualization library
can be changed if needed.

Add iperf bandwidth monitoring check to OpenWISP Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/iperf3-cli.jpg

.. Important::

  Languages and technologies used:
  **Python**, **Django**, **iperf3**.

  **Mentors**: Federico Capoano, Gagan Deep (more mentors TBA).

  **Project size**: 175 hours.

  **Difficulty rate**: easy/medium.

The goal of this project is to add a bandwidth test using ``iperf3``,
using the active check mechanism of
`OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/>`__.

The use case is to perform periodic bandwidth test to measure
the max bandwidth available (TCP test) and jitter (UDP).

On a macro level, the check would work this way:

1. OpenWISP connects to the device (only 1 check per device at time)
   via SSH and launches iperf3 as a client, first in TCP mode,
   then in UDP mode, iperf is launched with the ``-j``
   flag to obtain json output
2. The collected data is parsed and stored
   as a metric (bandwidth information and jitter)
3. SSH connection is closed

Pre-requisites to work on this project
######################################

The student must demonstrate good understanding of
`OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#openwisp-monitoring>`__,
and familiarity with Linux and iperf3.

Expected outcomes
#################

The outcomes we expect from this project are the following:

- Create iperf check class, the check must use the connection
  module of openwisp-controller to connect to devices using SSH
- If a device has no active Connection the check will be skipped and
  a warning logged
- This check should be optional and disabled by default
- We can run it by default every night
- Allow configuring the iperf server globally and by
  organization with a setting, eg:

.. code-block:: python

    OPENWISP_MONITORING_IPERF_SERVERS = {
        '': ['<DEFAULT_IPERF_SERVER_HERE>'],
        '<org-pk>': ['<ORG_IPERF_SERVER>']
    }

- It shall be possible to specify a list of iperf servers,
  this is important because on larger systems 1 server will not be enough
- We have to implement a lock to allow only 1 iperf check per
  server at time that is: for every server available,
  `only 1 check can be performed at any one time
  <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time>`_,
  so the lock has to take this account when calculating the cache-key
- SSH into device, launch iperf TCP client, repeat for UDP,
  collect data of both tests in a data structure
- Handle failures, if server is down, we can store 0, which would
  trigger an alert (investigate the alert settings functionality)
- Implement logic which creates the metric, chart and alert
  settings objects
- Save data (tcp max bandwidth, UDP jitter)
- Document how this check works
- Document how to set up and use the check step by step
  (explain also how to set up a new iperf server)
- Achieve at least 99% test coverage for the code added for this feature.

`[monitoring/checks] Add iperf check <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/issues/120>`_.

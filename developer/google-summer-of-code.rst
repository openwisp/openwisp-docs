How to run a successful Google Summer of Code
---------------------------------------------

**First of all: PLEASE, PLEASE, read all the information contained in
this page (including links!)** because this will save everybody involved
a lot of time.  We would rather spend our time coding than repeating
the same stuff over and over.

Have you read the `Student manual
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#student_guide>`_
yet?  If not, please do **because it's a MUST if you want to be
successful**!

**Communication with the rest of the community** is vital for a
successful Google Summer of Code, please join `our communication channels
<https://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, join our mailing list (we have a
`dedicated mailing list for GSoC
<https://groups.google.com/g/openwisp-gsoc>`_,
receive all emails please, and filter them in your mail box so they are
moved to an "OpenWISP" folder),
`present yourself in our general chat <https://gitter.im/openwisp/general>`_,
tell us who you are, what your values are, what is attracting to OpenWISP
and don't be cold like a robot! Stay human :-).

Traits we look for in applicants
--------------------------------

We participate in GSoC because we believe it's a great opportunity
for us to give back to Open Source by helping newcomers to get trained
and thrive in this industry, but we also do it because we want to
grow the pool of maintainers of our project so we can help a
greater number of users to use OpenWISP successfully.

Contributors who also become maintainers and start working
professionally with OpenWISP are rare, but over time we found out the
traits that are good leading indicators for contributors who are likely
to become core members of our project, **here are the traits we look
for in GSoC applicants which give a higher chance of getting selected**:

- **Genuinely interested in networking**: we look for people who are
  genuinely attracted in the topics we cover because we believe they
  are the ones who most likely will benefit from
  a long term contribution to our project.
- **Participate actively**: they become active
  participants of the community,
  not just by submitting pull requests, but also
  by helping new users or reviewing
  patches of other less experienced contributors.
- **Put effort in understanding**:
  they put effort in understanding the problem
  they need to solve and the outcomes that is
  expected from them, which means
  actively researching the problem, expand the
  project idea with more details,
  create a prototype, note down a list of
  questions regarding points that
  are not clear.
- **Value the time of mentors**: they read carefully the description
  of issues and put effort in understanding what they have to do,
  when something is not clear they do not hesitate to explain the
  problem carefully via email or on github.
- **Parallelize tasks when waiting for a reply**: while they wait for
  mentors to review or answer their questions, they start tackling
  other issues for which they have enough information to get started,
  in order to avoid staying idle.
- **Value quality**: they ensure their work is of the highest quality and
  doesn't break existing features of the system thanks to thorough testing
  before flagging a patch as ready to be merged.

How to become an OpenWISP star
------------------------------

Here's a few quick tricks you can use to become a star in our community:

- read the :doc:`founding values and goals of OpenWISP
  <../general/values>`, are you on our side?
- study and follow closely the :doc:`contributing guidelines
  <../developer/contributing>`
- be patient in the interaction with your mentors, we are all
  volunteers, we are taking our time to mentor you from our free time
  which we usually spend family and loved ones
- we know our documentation is incomplete and fragmented, we are working
  hard to fix it; if you find a passage that is not clear or you have an
  idea about how to improve it, **please let us know!**
- start using OpenWISP 2: install it, run it, play with it; understand
  its structure
- start contributing (eg: fix easy bugs, write documentation,
  improve tests); look for open issues in our most used repositories on
  `github.com/openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp>`_ (ask in our
  support channels before starting to code please! we have many legacy
  repositories that are not under active development anymore)
- if we ask you to open an issue in one of our github repository, please
  take at least 5 minutes of time to write a proper bug report
- watch the `OpenWISP 2 presentation at the recent OpenWRT Summit 2017
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n531yTtJimU>`_ and read the slides of
  this `more technical OpenWISP 2 talk
  <https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoCapoano/applying-the-unix-philosophy-to-django-projects-a-report-from-the-real-world>`_
- try using OpenWISP in real use case scenarios (find out if there's a
  free wifi community near your area), spend time reading its code,
  ask questions
- try to participate in the community, if a fellow member is in need of
  help and you know how to help him, please do so, we will reward you

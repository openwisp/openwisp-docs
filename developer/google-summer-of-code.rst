How to run a successful Google Summer of Code
---------------------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/gci/success.jpg

**First of all: PLEASE, PLEASE, read all the information contained in this
page (including links!)** because this will save everybody involved a lot
of time. We would rather spend our time coding than repeating the same
stuff over and over.

Have you read the `Student manual
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#student_guide>`_
yet? If not, please do **because it's a MUST if you want to be
successful**!

**Communication with the rest of the community** is vital for a successful
Google Summer of Code, please join `our communication channels
<https://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, join our mailing list (we have a
`dedicated mailing list for GSoC
<https://groups.google.com/g/openwisp-gsoc>`_, receive all emails please,
and filter them in your mail box so they are moved to an "OpenWISP"
folder), `present yourself in our general chat
<https://gitter.im/openwisp/general>`_, tell us who you are, what your
values are, what is attracting to OpenWISP and don't be cold like a robot!
Stay human :-).

Traits we look for in applicants
--------------------------------

We participate in GSoC because we believe it's a great opportunity for us
to give back to Open Source by helping newcomers to get trained and thrive
in this industry, but we also do it because we want to grow the pool of
maintainers of our project so we can help a greater number of users to use
OpenWISP successfully.

Contributors who also become maintainers and start working professionally
with OpenWISP are rare, but over time we found out the traits that are
good leading indicators for contributors who are likely to become core
members of our project, **here are the traits we look for in GSoC
applicants which give a higher chance of getting selected**:

- **Genuinely interested in networking**: we look for people who are
  genuinely attracted in the topics we cover because we believe they are
  the ones who most likely will benefit from a long term contribution to
  our project.
- **Participate actively**: they become active participants of the
  community, not just by submitting pull requests, but also by helping new
  users or reviewing patches of other less experienced contributors.
- **Put effort in understanding**: they put effort in understanding the
  problem they need to solve and the outcomes that is expected from them,
  which means actively researching the problem, expand the project idea
  with more details, create a prototype, note down a list of questions
  regarding points that are not clear.
- **Value the time of mentors**: they read carefully the description of
  issues and put effort in understanding what they have to do, when
  something is not clear they do not hesitate to explain the problem
  carefully via email or on github.
- **Parallelize tasks when waiting for a reply**: while they wait for
  mentors to review or answer their questions, they start tackling other
  issues for which they have enough information to get started, in order
  to avoid staying idle.
- **Value quality**: they ensure their work is of the highest quality and
  doesn't break existing features of the system thanks to thorough testing
  before flagging a patch as ready to be merged.

How to become an OpenWISP star
------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/gci/star.jpg

Here's a few quick tricks you can use to become a star in our community:

- read the :doc:`founding values and goals of OpenWISP
  <../general/values>`, are you on our side?
- study and follow closely the :doc:`contributing guidelines
  <../developer/contributing>`
- be patient in the interaction with your mentors, we are all volunteers,
  we are taking our time to mentor you from our free time which we usually
  spend family and loved ones
- we know our documentation is incomplete and fragmented, we are working
  hard to fix it; if you find a passage that is not clear or you have an
  idea about how to improve it, **please let us know!**
- start using OpenWISP 2: install it, run it, play with it; understand its
  structure
- start contributing (e.g.: fix easy bugs, write documentation, improve
  tests); look for open issues in our most used repositories on
  `github.com/openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp>`_ (ask in our support
  channels before starting to code please! we have many legacy
  repositories that are not under active development anymore)
- if we ask you to open an issue in one of our github repository, please
  take at least 5 minutes of time to write a proper bug report
- watch the `OpenWISP 2 presentation at the recent OpenWrt Summit 2017
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n531yTtJimU>`_ and read the slides of
  this `more technical OpenWISP 2 talk
  <https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoCapoano/applying-the-unix-philosophy-to-django-projects-a-report-from-the-real-world>`_
- try using OpenWISP in real use case scenarios (find out if there's a
  free wifi community near your area), spend time reading its code, ask
  questions
- try to participate in the community, if a fellow member is in need of
  help and you know how to help him, please do so, we will reward you

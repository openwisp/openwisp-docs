---------------------------------------------

**First of all: PLEASE, PLEASE, read all the information contained in
this page (including links!)** because this will save everybody involved
a lot of time.  We would rather spend our time coding than repeating
the same stuff over and over.

Have you read the `Student manual
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#student_guide>`_
yet?  If not, please do **because it's a MUST if you want to be
successful**!

**Communication with the rest of the community** is vital for a
successful Google Summer of Code, please join `our communication channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, join our mailing list (receive all
emails please, and filter them in your mail box so they are moved to an
"OpenWISP" folder), present yourself on the mailing list and on chat,
tell us who you are, what your values are, what is attracting to OpenWISP
and don't be cold like a robot! Stay human :-).

How to become an OpenWISP star
------------------------------

Here's a few quick tricks you can use to become a star in our community:

- read the :doc:`founding values and goals of OpenWISP
  <../general/values>`, are you on our side?
- study and follow closely the :doc:`contributing guidelines
  <../developer/contributing>`
- be patient in the interaction with your mentors, we are all
  volunteers, we are taking our time to mentor you from our free time
  which we usually spend family and loved ones
- we know our documentation is incomplete and fragmented, we are working
  hard to fix it; if you find a passage that is not clear or you have an
  idea about how to improve it, **please let us know!**
- start using OpenWISP 2: install it, run it, play with it; understand
  its structure
- start contributing (eg: fix easy bugs, write documentation,
  improve tests); look for open issues in our most used repositories on
  `github.com/openwisp <https://github.com/openwisp>`_ (ask in our
  support channels before starting to code please! we have many legacy
  repositories that are not under active development anymore)
- if we ask you to open an issue in one of our github repository, please
  take at least 5 minutes of time to write a proper bug report
- watch the `OpenWISP 2 presentation at the recent OpenWRT Summit 2017
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n531yTtJimU>`_ and read the slides of
  this `more technical OpenWISP 2 talk
  <https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoCapoano/applying-the-unix-philosophy-to-django-projects-a-report-from-the-real-world>`_
- try using OpenWISP in real use case scenarios (find out if there's a
  free wifi community near your area), spend time reading its code,
  ask questions
- try to participate in the community, if a fellow member is in need of
  help and you know how to help him, please do so, we will reward you

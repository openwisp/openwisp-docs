have a very tangible positive effect from the first day of your participation**
and where **you can grow your tech skills at 360Â°**, then **CONGRATULATIONS!**

How to run a successful GCI
---------------------------

.. image:: ../images/gci/success.jpg

Have you read the `contest rules
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/contest-rules>`_ yet?
If not, please do!

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you may claim only one task at
time and if you decide you don't want to work on it anymore is totally fine
but **please** communicate it to your mentors and remove yourself from the task
on the Google Code-In dashboard so that someone else will be able to work on it.

**Communication with the rest of the community** is vital for a successful
Google Code-In, please join `our communication channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_, presenting yourself on the mailing list
and on chat, tell us who you are, what your values are, what is attracting
to OpenWISP and don't be cold like a robot! Stay human :-).

How to become an OpenWISP star
------------------------------

Here's a few quick tricks you can use to become a star in our community:

- read the :doc:`founding values and goals of OpenWISP <../general/values>`,
  are you on our side?
- study and follow closely the :doc:`contributing guidelines <../developer/contributing>`
- be patient in the interaction with your mentors, we are all volunteers, we are
  taking our time to mentor you from our free time which we usually spend with family
  and loved ones
- we know `our documentation <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp2-docs>`_ is
  incomplete and fragmented, we are working hard to improve it; if you find a passage
  that is not clear or you have an idea about how to improve it, **please let us know!**
- the same happens with the software, if you see something which looks like a bug,
  reach out, even if it's not a bug your feedback will help us to improve
- if we ask you to open an issue in one of our github repository, please take at
  least 5 minutes of time to write a proper bug report
- watch the `OpenWISP 2 presentation at the recent OpenWRT Summit 2017
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n531yTtJimU>`_ and read the slides of
  this `more technical OpenWISP 2 talk
  <https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoCapoano/applying-the-unix-philosophy-to-django-projects-a-report-from-the-real-world>`_
- try using OpenWISP in real use case scenarios (find out if there's a
  free wifi community near your area), spend time reading its code, ask questions
- try to participate in the community, if a fellow member is in need of help and
  you know how to help him, please do so, we will reward you

  You can ask for help whenever needed, but please don't copy someone else's work. Google Code-in has zero tolerance
  policy regarding cheating and plagiarism. There are some tasks which require a creative mind like designing logos and
  T-shirts, which you need to do by yourself. Remember, learning is more important than winning.

We wish you good luck for the contest!

Contributing guidelines
=======================

We are glad and thankful that you want to contribute to OpenWISP.

Please read these guidelines carefully, it will help you and us to save
precious time later.

Introduce yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It won't hurt to join `our main communication channels
<http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_ and introduce yourself; you can take
advantage of your introduction to share feedback, share your OpenWISP
derivative work, ask questions or announce your intentions.

Look for open issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out the `OpenWISP Contributor's Board
<https://github.com/orgs/openwisp/projects/3>`_, this is a kanban board
integrated with github were we place the most important issues we are
working on.

If there's anything you don't understand regarding the
board, don't hesitate to ask questions in our `general chat
<https://gitter.im/openwisp/general>`_.

Setup
~~~~~

Once you have chosen an issue to work on, read the ``README`` of the
repository in which the issue has been opened and follow the setup
instructions, each module has its own specific instructions and we highly
suggest you to read as much as possible.

How to commit your changes properly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our main development branch is master, it's our central development
branch.

Your code should be pushed from a different branch and then it is merged
into master after proper review from the project maintainers.

1. Branch naming guidelines
---------------------------

Create a new branch for your patch, use a self-descriptive name, eg:

::

  git pull origin master
  # if there's an issue for your patch
  git checkout -b issues/48
  # if you prefer a descriptive name
  git checkout -b autoregistration

2. Commit message style guidelines
----------------------------------

**Please follow our commit message style conventions**.

If the issue is present on Github, use following commit style:

::

    [module/file/feature] Short description #<issue-number>

    Long description here.
    Fixes #<issue-number>

Here's a real world commit message example from `one of our modules
<https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig/commit/7a5dad9f97e708b89149c2765f8298c5a94b652b>`_:

    [admin] Fixed VPN context in preview #57

    Fortunately it was just a frontend JS issue.
    The preview instance was getting the UUID of the Device
    object instead of the Config object, and that prevented
    the system from finding the associated VPN and fill the
    context VPN keys correctly.

    Fixes #57

Moreover, keep in mind the following guidelines:

- commits should be descriptive in nature, the message should
  explain the nature of the change
- make sure to follow the code style used in the module
  you are contributing to
- before committing and pushing the changes, test the code both manually
  and automatically with the automated test suite if applicable
- after pushing your branch code, make a pull-request of that
  corresponding change of yours which should contain a descriptive
  message and mention the issue number as suggested in the example above

3. Pull-Request guidelines
--------------------------

After pushing your changes to your fork, prepare a new Pull Request
(from now on we will shorten it often to just *PR*):

- from your forked repository of the project select your branch and
  click "New Pull Request"
- check the changes tab and review the changes again to ensure everything
  is correct
- write a concise description of the PR, if an issue exists for
- after submitting your PR, check back again whether your PR has passed
  our required tests and style checks
- if the tests fail for some reason, try to fix them and if you get
  stuck seek our help on `our communication channels
  <http://openwisp.org/support.html>`_
- if the tests pass, maintainers will review the PR and may ask
  you to improve details or changes, please be patient: creating a good
  quality open source project takes a bit of sweat and effort; ensure
  to follow up with this type of operations
- once everything is fine with us we'll merge your PR

4. Avoiding unnecessary changes
-------------------------------

- while making changes to the required files, then saving it and
  comitting it, different contributors often find that there occur same
  changes that they have not made and those changes gets committed with
  the desired change that the person wants to make
- these unnecessary changes should be evaluated first and then the
  commit should be made
- these changes generally occur due to different settings and
  customizations of your editor that you are working with. These changes
  are produced on their own as soon as you save a file. Examples are -
  Introducing new lines, removing and adding spaces, etc
- to avoid such changes please check your editor settings first. If this
  sort of behaviour persists please use any command line editor like
  VIM, etc

General suggestions and warnings
--------------------------------

- **Project ideas describe the goals we want to achieve but may miss
  details that have to be defined during the project**: we expect
  applicants to do their own research, propose solutions and be ready to
  deal with uncertainty and solve challenges that will come up during the
  project
- **Code and prototypes are preferred over detailed documents and
  unreliable estimates**: rather than using your time to write a very long
  application document, we suggest to invest in writing a prototype (which
  means the code may be thrown out entirely) which will help you
  understand the challenges of the project you want to work on; your
  application should refer to the prototype or other Github contributions
  you made to OpenWISP that show you have the capability to succeed in the
  project idea you are applying for.
- **Applicants who have either shown to have or have shown to be fast
  learners for the required hard and soft skills by contributing to
  OpenWISP have a lot more chances of being accepted**: in order to get
  started contributing refer to the :doc:`OpenWISP Contributing Guidelines
  <../developer/contributing>`
- **Get trained in the projects you want to apply for**: once applicants
  have completed some basic training by :doc:`contributing to OpenWISP
  <../developer/contributing>` we highly suggest to start working on some
  aspects of the project they are interested in applying: all projects
  listed this year are improvements of existing modules so these modules
  already have a list of open issues which can be solved as part of your
  advanced training. It will also be possible to complete some of the
  tasks listed in the project idea right now before GSoC starts. We will
  list some easy tasks in the project idea for this purpose.

Project Ideas
-------------

Improve OpenWISP General Map: Indoor, Mobile, Linkable URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/2024/maps.jpg

.. important::

    Languages and technologies used: **Python**, **Django**,
    **JavaScript**, **Leaflet**, **netjsongraph.js**.

    **Mentors**: *Federico Capoano*, *Gagan Deep*.

    **Project size**: 350 hours.

    **Difficulty rate**: medium.

This GSoC project aims to enhance the user experience of the general map
within OpenWISP, a feature introduced in the last stable version.

By developing a dedicated map page, facilitating precise device tracking,
and seamlessly integrating indoor floor plans, the project endeavors to
significantly improve the usability and functionality of the mapping
interface, ensuring a more intuitive and effective user experience.

Prerequisites to work on this project
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Applicants must demonstrate a solid understanding of Python, Django,
`Leaflet library <https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-leaflet>`_,
JavaScript, `OpenWISP Controller
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#openwisp-controller>`__,
`OpenWISP Monitoring
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#openwisp-monitoring>`__.
and `netjsongraph.js
<https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js?tab=readme-ov-file#netjsongraphjs>`__.

Expected outcomes
+++++++++++++++++

- `Add a dedicated map page
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/issues/561>`_:
  Introduce a dedicated page to display all network devices on a map. This
  view will offer the same functionality as the map in the dashboard, with
  the sole difference being that this page focuses on rendering only the
  map. It will be used for linking specific points on the map within the
  rest of the OpenWISP UI.
- `Allow tracking mobile coordinates
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/828>`_: OpenWISP
  Controller provides a way for devices to update their co-ordinates, we
  want to make the map able to update in real time as devices send their
  updated coordinates.
- `Integrate indoor floor plan functionality in the map
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/issues/564>`_: The
  netjsongraph.js library allows to render indoor maps, we want to make
  use of this feature to display the indoor location of devices and we
  want this feature to be accessible from the general map. When zooming in
  on a device which is flagged as indoor and has floor plans saved in the
  database, users should see an option to switch to the indoor view. This
  view would show the floor plan of the indoor location and any device
  located on the floor plan, it shall also account for the following use
  cases:

      - An indoor location can have multiple floors. The view should be
        allow users to navigate between different floors.
      - There can be multiple devices on the same floor. The view should
        show all the devices on a floor. This will require developing an
        API endpoint which returns location of devices on the floor plan

- `Make map actions bookmarkable
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/238>`_: Update the
  URL when clicking on a node/link to view its details. Visiting this URL
  should automatically focus on the specified node/link and display its
  details, if available. This functionality should also accommodate
  geo-maps using coordinates. Clicking on a node/link to view it's details
  should update the the page's URL. When visiting this URL, the map should
  automatically focus the said node/link. It shall also open the
  node's/link's details if they are available. This should work on
  geographic maps, indoor maps and logical maps.
- `Add button to general map from device detail
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/issues/562>`_:
  Implement a button on the device detail page to allow users to navigate
  from the device detail to the general map and inspect the device's
  location on the map. The map should focus on the specific device in
  question. This feature should also be available for indoor maps,
  providing a button in the floor plan section to open the general map
  with the indoor view focused.

Throughout the code changes, it is imperative to maintain stable test
coverage and keep the README documentation up to date.

.. note::

    The "expected outcomes" mentioned above include links to corresponding
    GitHub issues. However, these issues may not cover all aspects of the
    project and are primarily intended to gather technical details.
    Applicants are encouraged to seek clarification, propose solutions and
    open more issues if needed.

Applicants are also expected to deepen their understanding of the UI
changes required by preparing *wireframes* or *mockups*, which must be
included in their application. Demonstrating a willingness and enthusiasm
to learn about UI/UX development is crucial for the success of this
project.

Improve netjsongraph.js resiliency and visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/gsoc/ideas/netjsongraph-default.png

.. important::

    Languages and technologies used: **Javascript**, **NodeJS**, **HTML**,
    **CSS**

    **Mentors**: *Federico Capoano* (more mentors TBA).

    **Project size**: 175 hours.

    **Difficulty rate**: medium.

The goal of this project is to improve the latest version of the
netjsongraph.js visualization library to improve resiliency and
functionality.

Prerequisites to work on this project
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The contributor should have a proven track record and experience with
Javascript, React JS, NodeJS, HTML and CSS.

Familiarity with `OpenWISP Network Topology
<https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology>`__ and `OpenWISP
Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring>`__ is a plus.

Expected outcomes
+++++++++++++++++

The applicant must open pull requests for the following issues which must
be merged by the final closing date of the program:

- `Allow showing node names on geo map on high zoom levels
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/189>`_: The node
  names should be shown by default on high zoom levels.
- `Map should respect zoom levels of tile providers
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/188>`_: We shall
  limit the map zoom levels based on the tile provider. We can make the
  supported zoom levels configurable and provide sensible defaults.
- `Prevent overlapping of clusters
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/171>`_: The clusters
  of different categories with the same location are overlapped. Instead,
  we should find a way to prevent this behavior.
- `Add resiliency for invalid data
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/164>`_: The library
  should not crash if invalid data is provided, e.g. different nodes with
  same ID. Instead, it should handle such cases gracefully and log the
  errors.
- `Display additional data (connected clients) on nodes
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/153>`_: It shall be
  possible to show connected clients on nodes. This feature needs to be
  flexible, such that it can be used to show different kinds of data.
- `Show node labels only after hitting a certain zoom level
  <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph.js/issues/148>`_: At present,
  the node labels become cluttered and unreadable when zoomed out
  excessively. To enhance readability, we need to add a feature in the
  library that allows configuring the zoom level at which node labels
  should start appearing.

Each issue contains the details which the applicant needs to know in order
to complete the project successfully.

At each step of code changing the test coverage must be maintained stable
and the documentation in the README must be kept up to date.
